My name is Zhitai Zhang, you can call me Tai.
My student number is 3762085 and email is zhangzhitaigreat@gmai.com.
I'm from China. I have been in Melbourne for a year. Last year, I read the phonetics in the language version of rmit. I just entered university this year. University life makes me feel very happy, because I know a lot of friends, but due to the epidemic this year, it makes my life a little bit uncomfortable. But online classes also brought me a different experience.
My mother tongue is Chinese, but after a year of learning English, I can now communicate. My hobby is to play football and already play games. My favorite football star is Messi and my favorite team is Barcelona. My favorite game is League of Legends. Due to the epidemic, I can’t play football with my friends, so I will play League of Legends with my friends. .
I chose the major of IT because I am very interested in this major, and I think this major is a very promising major. Now that the society tends to be modernized, scientific and technical personnel are indispensable, especially IT professionals, so On the one hand, this is a major that I am interested in. On the other hand, I also want to make some developments in this field to help society progress. Another more important reason is that IT staff are generally paid very high. I think it is a good thing to get a high-paying job. And I came to rmit to study because the IT major of rmit is a more famous and popular major in the world. I think I can really learn knowledge by coming here.

Regarding the design of IT, I have an idea that is to automatically raise and lower the underground parking lot. With the development of society, people’s living standards have gradually improved. Almost everyone has at least one car at home, especially in China. With a large population and improved living standards, parking has become the biggest problem. Parking spaces will take a lot of time. As this problem became more serious, my idea gradually came to mind. It works like this. First, dig an underground garage underground, and then draw some parking lines on the ground. When there is a car on the parking line, the sensor will be sensed and transmitted to the control center, and the control center will pass The code calculation turns on the elevator, the car is automatically lifted to the parking lot and placed according to the number, and then the car owner's number is given. When the car owner returns to the parking position, the number is scanned by the computer, the computer automatically recognizes the number, and the corresponding number The car is given to the owner through the elevator. In this way, a lot of space can be saved, and the parking problem can be solved objectively. However, there are some disadvantages in such a design. The most important point is the high cost. It is difficult for companies or governments to afford such a design. Secondly, the current technology only exists in theory, because all roads need to be changed to automatic The lifting of the road surface is currently unattainable by technology, but with the development of technology, it is expected to be realized in the future.
